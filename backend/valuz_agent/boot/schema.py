"""Host-side schema bootstrap — standard incremental Alembic migrations.

The host owns its own alembic chain at ``backend/alembic/host`` with a
non-default ``version_table = alembic_version_host`` so it does NOT
collide with the kernel's ``alembic_version`` row in the same SQLite
file.

``run_host_migrations`` runs ``alembic upgrade head`` against the live DB.
Schema changes ship as new, reversible revisions chained onto the existing
head; existing data is migrated in place, never dropped.

This replaced the earlier pre-launch "0-migration" policy, which held a single
regenerated baseline and dropped every ``valuz_*`` table on any stamp mismatch.
Now that the product is released, user data must survive upgrades, so that
wholesale-reset probe is gone — every change is a real migration.
